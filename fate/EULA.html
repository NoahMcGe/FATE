WildTangent hereby grants you a non-exclusive, personal and limited license to install and use the Software internally on a single computer at a time to view or interact with content, such as artwork, pictures, text, video, audio, media files, programs or applications, that accesses the Software ("Content").

You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sublicense, distribute, transmit, share (over a network or otherwise) or create derivative works based upon, the Software or any File Format. Except pursuant to a WildTangent Distribution License Agreement, you may not distribute, transmit or share (over a network or otherwise), any WildTangent File or any Content, in whole or part. You may not transfer your rights under this License.
</p><p>
</p><p>
You agree not to view a WildTangent File or Content by any means other than by use of the Software. You acknowledge and agree that the Software may prevent the viewing of Content that is not Authorized Content.

3. Creation of Content.
</p><p>
If you desire to create any files in any of the File Formats, you must do so either by using tools created by WildTangent in accordance with the terms and conditions of the license agreement applicable to such WildTangent tools, or by using tools provided by a third party (in accordance with any license agreement applicable to such tools) which have been approved by WildTangent. Information about WildTangent tools can be found at: <a href="http://www.wildtangent.com/" target=new>http://www.wildtangent.com/</a>. While you are free to create Content, you agree that you may not distribute Content to, transmit Content to, or share Content with any third party (over a network or otherwise), unless you agree to the terms and conditions of the WildTangent "Distribution License Agreement." You agree that you may not authorize any third party to sell, license, distribute, transmit, share or give away any Content unless such third party holds a license from WildTangent to distribute such Content and you have confirmed with WildTangent that such third party is so licensed.
